# ❤️ Love By AI

⚠️ WARNING: Copious amounts of Brainrot involved.

Love By AI is a parody of the game [Death by AI](https://bobbodev.itch.io/death-by-ai) from BobboDev.

Instead of trying to Solve deadly scenarios and try and come up with a survival strategy that the AI approves of, the goal of the game is to successfully RIZZ UP the AI with preset personalities and date scenarios that you can choose! 
(Free player input personalities and dates for future update)

You can try this now at: https://markneoneo.itch.io/love-by-ai
